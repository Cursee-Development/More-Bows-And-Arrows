The objective of More Bows and Arrows is to improve the adventure and combat of the games, adding dozens of new bows and arrows. These can be created using other vanilla materials, and of course, they will have characteristics consistent with the materials.

All bows and arrows have been designed with vanilla features in mind, so it will be as if the Minecraft developers had released a version improving these aspects.

Now you can use new wooden bows, natural elements, or of course, the most desired ones, those made of minerals! The more expensive a preparation is, the greater the advantages offered.

**Is it compatible with other mods that add bows or arrows?**

In principle there would be no problem in making use of these bows with other arrows added by other mods of the style. In any case, if you find any compatibility problem you can contact us and we will get to work.

**Can this mod be used in modpacks?**

Of course! As long as it is published only on Modrinth or CurseForge. Uploading it to any other platform would be violating our rights and is not allowed at all.

However, we are really grateful if you consider adding it to your Modrinth or CurseForge modpack. If you need any small changes or have any questions, contact us!
